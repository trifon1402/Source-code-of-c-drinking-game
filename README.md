# Alcohol Skill Game

## Description
Alcohol Skill Game is a text-based game where players can improve their drinking skills, manage their stability, and level up. Players select drinks from a shop that affect their stability and can upgrade their skills with accumulated points.

## Features
- Choose drinks with varying stability loss.
- Increase drinking skill and maximum stability.
- Leveling system that rewards players with points.
- Stability recovery over time.
- Save and load game progress.

## Planned Features
1. Fix the stability gain in the settings menu.
2. Ensure that skill points are correctly tracked.
3. Adjust starting stability from 100 to 0.
4. Investigate and resolve any additional issues.
5. Introduce a boss fight. The first boss, "Qnkata," will drink "Pirinsko" and will have a stability of 16, unlike the player who starts with 100 stability.
